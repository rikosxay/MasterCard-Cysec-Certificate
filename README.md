<h1>Mastercard Cybersecurity Certificate </h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
In this project I completed a series of tasks meant to replicate the day to day activities of a Cybersecurity Analyst at Mastercard. I was able to do this through Forage's job simulation platform.
<br />Here is a brief of the tasks I was able to perform:<br />
* Completed a job simulation where I served as an analyst on Mastercard’s
  Security Awareness Team <br />
* Helped identify and report security threats such as phishing <br />
* Analyzed and identified which areas of the business needed more robust
  security training and implemented training courses and procedures for those
  teams
<br />



<h2>Project walk-through:</h2>
This project begins with a brief giving crucial context required for the job simulation including a short explanation of the topic of "Phishing". <br />
We begin by answering two questions regarding a sample phishing email as shown below: <br />
