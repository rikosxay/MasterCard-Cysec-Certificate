<h1>Mastercard Cybersecurity Certificate </h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
In this project I completed a series of tasks meant to replicate the day to day activities of a Cybersecurity Analyst at Mastercard. I was able to do this through Forage's job simulation platform.
<br />Here is a brief of the tasks I was able to perform:<br />

- Completed a job simulation where I served as an analyst on Mastercard’s
  Security Awareness Team <br />
- Helped identify and report security threats such as phishing <br />
- Analyzed and identified which areas of the business needed more robust
  security training and implemented training courses and procedures for those
  teams
<br />



<h2>Project walk-through:</h2>
This project begins with a brief giving crucial context required for the job simulation including a short explanation of the topic of "Phishing". <br />
<br />

<br /> 

We begin by answering two questions regarding a sample phishing email as shown below: <br />
<p align="center">
Question 1:  <br/><br/>

<br />
Question 2:  <br/><br/>

<br />

Then we are tasked with crafting a phishing email of ourselves with the knowledge gained about phishing emails.
</p>

Here is the email I wrote: <br/><br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/kPakydr.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Phishing email"/>
<br />
</p>

As you can see I added a more relevant and crucial subject to the email that would generate a hasty response from a Mastercard employee as they would not want their data to be lost in a data breach. Furthermore I added the IT contact email and a confidentiality disclaimer to add to the perceived authenticity of the email.
<br />
<br /> 
Now for the second task we are made to analyze some data regarding the Mastercard phishing simulation and figure out which department is the most vulnerable to phishing attacks and then prepare a presentation to educate the department to prevent further phishing attacks.

<br />
<br />
From the table we see that the HR and Marketing teams are the most vulnerable:  <br/> <br />

<br />
<br />
Finally we create a presentation to educate the departments and raise awareness regarding phishing. Here is the presentation I made:  <br/> <br/>

<br />
<br />

Overall this was a great learning experience for me as I got to be in the shoes of a Cybersecurity Analyst at Mastercard and tackle an incident as they would. <br/>
Thank you for reading my report on this project. <br/>
